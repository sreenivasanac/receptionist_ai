## These are features but future consideration, not implemented now
### Pre-Visit Intake & Digital Forms

**Applicable Verticals:** Medical & Specialty Care, Health & Wellness, Medspas

**Problem It Solves:** Front desk staff spend significant time collecting health history, consent forms, allergies, and treatment goals before appointments. Patients often arrive unprepared, causing delays. For medical/aesthetic procedures, compliance documentation is critical.

**How It Works:** 
- After booking, the AI proactively collects pre-visit information through conversational Q&A
- Gathers health history, current medications, allergies, contraindications, treatment goals
- Collects digital consent and acknowledgments for procedures
- Saves responses to CRM/EHR and flags any concerns for provider review
- Sends reminders if forms are incomplete before the appointment

**Example Interaction:**
> **Customer:** I just booked a Botox consultation for Thursday.
> **AI:** Great! To prepare for your visit, I have a few quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications? Are you currently taking blood thinners? Have you had Botox or fillers before?

### Waitlist & Cancellation Recovery

**Applicable Verticals:** All (Beauty, Wellness, Medical, Fitness)

**Problem It Solves:** Popular time slots fill up quickly, turning away potential customers. When cancellations happen, businesses lose revenue and struggle to fill last-minute openings. Customers have no easy way to grab a cancelled slot.

**How It Works:**
- When no slots are available for a customer's preferred time, AI offers to add them to a waitlist
- Collects preferred dates/times, flexibility window, and contact preference
- When a cancellation occurs, AI automatically notifies waitlisted customers in priority order
- Enables instant booking confirmation through the chat or quick-reply link
- Tracks waitlist conversion metrics for the business

**Example Interaction:**
> **Customer:** Do you have anything Saturday morning?
> **AI:** Saturday mornings are fully booked right now, but I can add you to our priority waitlist. If anything opens up, I'll message you immediately and you can grab the slot. What's the best way to reach you — text or email?
