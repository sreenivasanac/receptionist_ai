### Waitlist & Cancellation Recovery

**Applicable Verticals:** All (Beauty, Wellness, Medical, Fitness)

**Problem It Solves:** Popular time slots fill up quickly, turning away potential customers. When cancellations happen, businesses lose revenue and struggle to fill last-minute openings. Customers have no easy way to grab a cancelled slot.

**How It Works:**
- When no slots are available for a customer's preferred time, AI offers to add them to a waitlist
- Collects preferred dates/times, flexibility window, and contact preference
- When a cancellation occurs, AI automatically notifies waitlisted customers in priority order
- Enables instant booking confirmation through the chat or quick-reply link
- Tracks waitlist conversion metrics for the business

**Example Interaction:**
> **Customer:** Do you have anything Saturday morning?
> **AI:** Saturday mornings are fully booked right now, but I can add you to our priority waitlist. If anything opens up, I'll message you immediately and you can grab the slot. What's the best way to reach you — text or email?
