 Create tech stack for this implementation 
 in @agentic_development_docs/project_design
 _plan/3_tech_stack.md
 Use Agno SDK for Agentic workflow. 
 Use Python 3.
 Use Sqlite as database.
 For authentication, have only username and 
 role, no password for now. 
 Ask any clarification question related to 
 tech stack if any. Don't ask clarification 
 question just for the sake. If some tech 
 stack decision make sense, go ahead with 
 that.


 Create initial plan combining these, as 
 PRD-like / features list - in the order of 
 implementation - v1, v2, v3 . Keep basic 
 features only - since this is like MVP.

 It should have admin panel for business to 
 login.

 Business owner should be able to select 
 their service type, update some of their 
 information etc from their side. They 
 should be able to give list of website 
 links - and then a button which when they 
 press, it should go and fetch information 
 from the website.

 Business owner should be able to select the
 list of the features that they would want 
 in the chatbot. 

 Come up with such basic features to show as
 MVP - update in @agentic_development_docs/
 project_design_plan/2_initial_plan.md 

 From chat perspective, come up with prd / 
 features - and bit about the 
 implementation. Divide these features into 
 v1, v2, v3 - so that we will implement each
 version one by one.

 Ask any clarifying question related to AI 
 receptionist chatbot features. Don't ask 
 just for the sake of asking - ask for 
 things which need clarifying.
